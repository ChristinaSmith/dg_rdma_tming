Code Consult : Limited guidance in email
ssiegel 2013-06-12

6AM
+ Expanded BSV sources from "broken_bsv_src.tar" to cms-consult
+ No README, will make my own way
+ Looked the archive "broken.tar", but missing the vivado.log I need to see what you did
+ Plan will be to work from BSV source, and mine select files from "broken" if and when needed
+ Cleaned *~ detritus from bsv directory
+ Found real 34 bsv source files.
+ No .bspec or Makefile - had to make my own, witll try compile to Bluesim first
+ Compiles, warnings, simulates (no error or success indication, but terminates with
[17010] simulation cycle:1700 ...
[18010] simulation cycle:1800 ...
[19010] simulation cycle:1900 ...
Terminating Simulation...
Simulation finished
+ Can't be sure if that is good or bad without looking deeper
+ quick looks at sim/dump.vcd says that something is going on, can't tell if good or bad
+ Since this is not a code-review consult; but a "why bad build" consult, accepting compiled code as-is and moving on

630AM
+ Create project for RTL/XSIM target
+ Compiled FTop_mmv05_toBit to xsim target; compiled, warnings, 18 rtl/mk*.v files created, skipped xsim simulation
+ Note: Would like to come back and see Vivado Simulator (xsim) match Bluesim, but skipping this step due to time limits
+ Write simple makefile and make clean to get bearings
+ Find two different .xdc files in Vivado tree. Rescue imports/testWire/kc705.xdc to /constrs dir (source file recovered)
+ Mine "broken" for non-BSV Verilog sources; find 116 Verilog files
+ Rescue "fpgaTop_mm705.v" to /rtl dir (source file recovered)

700AM
+ Drop in lib/bsv for self-contained use (so you can build when no BSV is installed on system)
+ Copy across mkCRC32.v into /rtl
+ Fire up Vivado GUI just to see if we can synth w/o errors, have all sources, and can browse design
+ Synth complete w/o error; open design to look around. 110 Warnings, some suspicious:
[Synth 8-3848] Net p_0_in in module/entity mkFAU does not have driver.
[Synth 8-3848] Net p_0_in in module/entity mkFDU does not have driver.
[Synth 8-4446] all outputs are unconnected for this instance and logic may be removed ["/home/shep/projects/cms-consult/vivado/project_1/project_1.srcs/sources_1/imports/rtl/mkGMAC.v":1016]

[Synth 8-350] instance 'ftop' of module 'mkFTop_mm705' requires 23 connections, but only 20 given ["/home/shep/projects/cms-consult/vivado/project_1/project_1.srcs/sources_1/imports/rtl/fpgaTop_mm705.v":43]
+ Not sure what the p_0 nets are, will come back to this
+ The four unconnected instances at GMAC and QBGMAC look OK (they are unused control signals, OK to trim)
+ Looking at the 23/20 disparity between mkTop / no issue there, just 3 unused clock/gate outputs OK as is (should clean up, but no issue)

730AM
+ Nothing jumping out as a show-stopper; kicking off implementation.
+ Ten failing paths on TX ports. The output_delay constraints for gmii_tx* are bogus, removed
+ make clean, archive, rebuild...

800AM
+ Synth has 110 Warning; Impl has 1 warning; Now 10 failing paths are on gmii_RX inputs, also source-sync to provided RX clock
+ Comparing with other projects using GMAC core
+ Noticed your GMAC.bsv was not in sync with AR Hotline repo, updated. Our hotline designs don't have this issue, your's shouldn't either
+ Note that new E8023.bsv now includes ABS.bsv
+ Updated XilinxExtra.bsv (just to sync, no obvious changes)
+ Perform sanity-check BSV builds to check if anything obvious broke with the BSV source syncing.

900AM
+ In build process, found more hidden .foo.swo and .foo.swp files, removed (was blocking vi write commits)
+ Bluesim test - same results as before (not sure if good or bad, but runs w/o error to termination)
+ Xsim test - Xsim failed as before, but succeeded in making Verilog rtl files (should fix XSIM, but can move on)
+ make clean to remove all non-essential
+ now, in a clean, empty /vivado directory, re-run to see if any different
$ vivado -source ../tcl/sls_build1.tcl
+ This is just a machine-specific shortcut to run the synth and impl as before, and from the GUI (for CMS) but with less mouse clicking
+ As this implememts, the thought on my mind is will or wont this clear the RX GMII timing violations?
+ Like the TX, which had wrong XDC constraints, the RX is source-sync, but a receiver, should not have setup violations
+ Report Timing Summary shows no negative slack
+ I don't think I fixed anything broken as much as synced up some stale E8023/ABS/GMAC/XilinxExtra BSV and tweaked XDC, some source

930AM
+ Let's make a bistream; we close timing and use 15274 FFs, 14535 LUTs, 16 BRAM
+ On loading bitstream, GbE Link up (1000 and DUP Leds on); LED[7:4] do binary count, no observed traffic, though
+ Pressed reset switch and same think; Link comes up; Led[7:3] count. Not sure if this is good or bad
+ We have a timing-closed bitstream with sources from BSV->Verilog->Bitstream
+ make clean to archive, and send to CMS for review
+ copy bitstream to bit/fpgaTop_20130612_0953.bit, nuke contents of vivado dir before archive
+ make tarball and send to CMS
